Car Rental System Built using Java
----------------------------------
This project is a Car Rental System implemented in Java, showcasing the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The system features a user interface built with forms to facilitate the rental of cars. The primary goal of this project is to illustrate the effective utilization of OOP principles in a real-world context.

**Features**
- User Interface: The system offers a user-friendly interface with forms that allow users to interact with the application seamlessly.
- Car Inventory: Users can browse through a collection of available cars for rent. Each car is represented as an object with attributes like make, model, year, and rental price.
- Renting Process: Users can select a car and initiate the renting process. The system handles the booking details, including rental duration and associated costs.
- Object-Oriented Design: The system is designed using OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Each car is an instance of a class, and the code is organized into meaningful classes and relationships.
- Data Persistence: The system may incorporate data persistence to store information about cars, bookings, and users. This ensures that data is retained even after the application is closed.
----------------------------------
**Object-Oriented Programming Concepts**
- Classes and Objects: Cars are represented as objects, each belonging to a specific class. The classes define attributes (properties) and behaviors (methods) of the objects.
- Encapsulation: Access to class properties is controlled through access modifiers. Encapsulation ensures that data is accessed and modified only through well-defined methods.
- Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of a hierarchy of classes, inheriting properties and behaviors from parent classes. For example, a general "Car" class may be inherited by more specific classes like "Sedan" or "SUV."
- Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through method overriding and interfaces. This can be employed when dealing with various car types or rental scenarios.

**To run the Car Rental System:**
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
3. Build and run the project.
4. Use the provided forms to interact with the Car Rental System, explore available cars, and initiate the renting process.
